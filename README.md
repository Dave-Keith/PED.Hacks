# Welcome to PED.Hacks!

## A resource for solutions to common issues related to IT/coding in the DFOsphere. 

If you're looking for a solution, try **searching** for some keywords or browsing the folders. 
You're welcome to clone this repository to your computer so that you have all the hacks at your fingertips, or 
you can just re-visit this page and copy/paste as needed.

If you want to **contribute**, first off, **thanks**! Please ask to be added as a contributor, 
and then clone the repository. Upload/save your hack in a relevant folder or edit someone else's hack if necessary.
A la Wikipedia, anyone can edit/read anything here, so please keep that in mind. No getting upset
if someone breaks some code you shared (just revert it via github!). 

## A few ground rules:
- Be organized! Some of us have an aversion to messy file structures, so please save files in a logical folder, 
  or create a new folder if necessary.
- Write reproducible code! If you're offering a solution involving code, please try to make it general enough for 
  others to run without issue. 
- Annotate clearly! We want this to be an information source for everyone (noob to guru), so please annotate/comment your code really       well. 
- Be nice and be chill! This is just a space to help each other out and save one another the occasional frustrations 
  caused by the structure in which we operate. This is not stackexchange, there are no points, and the only reputation you 
  gain is amongst your colleagues. :)
